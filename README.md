Garbage Scavenge is an educational game targeted towards a younger audience. It educates the user on disposal methods and their importance and impact on the environment. Garbage Scavenge was made with p5 Javascript and hosted on Replit. The graphics used were taken from Canva. This program was coded in the span of 24 hours by our group of three (including Hannalee Wu and Lily Wang) for the LunarHacks hackathon.
